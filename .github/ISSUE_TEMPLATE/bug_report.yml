        Please post the relevant code sample here.

        We can address your report more quickly if:

          - The code sample is concise and clear.
          - It does not rely on external libraries.
          - A comparison or workaround is provided.

        Reports may be slower to investigate if:
          - There is too much extraneous code.
          - We need to clone a large repo and verify that the issue lies elsewhere.
          - The sample is confusing or doesn't clearly demonstrate the issue.
